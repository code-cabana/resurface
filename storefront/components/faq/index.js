          <span>Which browsers can I use {name} with?</span>
          <p>
            Google Chrome is currently supported. Firefox and Safari are on the
            way.

          <span>What websites can I use {name} on?</span>
          <p>
            {name} can be used on any website that utilizes a CodeMirror editor.
            At the time of writing this includes Squarespace, Shopify, Wix,
            Klaviyo + more.

        <li>
          <span>If {name} crashes, will I lose my work?</span>
          <p>
            No, changes made within a {name} editor are instantly synced across
            to the webpage that opened it, meaning that the website builder will
            always be up to date on your progress

          <span>What is your refund policy?</span>

            issue refunds. Please try the free version, or{" "}
